    <h1>Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Howdy! I'm Barent.</p>
    <p>I am a full stack software engineer with an eclectic background in publication coordination, classroom instruction, and caregiving. I use the skills I have gained over a lifetime of working with people to approach problem-solving with flexibility, enthusiasm, and empathy; I lift up my colleagues and I get the job done. Inspired by the helpers and the redemption stories, I champion the human heart with each line of code I compose. </p>
